# Challenge

Create Chess board is an 8 by 8 grid of alternating black and white squares. The queens are red and blue squares.

Each board will have one red and one blue queen at different coordinates. In addition to displaying the board you’ll need to identify if the queens are “under attack” based on their coordinates.

# Approach & Efficiency

Define a ChessBoard class

- should have add_red method that accepts a row and column as input
- should have add_blue method that accepts a row and column as input
- should have render method that displays the chess board on screen with red and blue shown in correct locations
- should have is_under_attack method that return boolean if red is under attack by a blue piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally
